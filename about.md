### About Me
#### Personal Background
I grew up near Iowa City, Iowa, and I really like the area. Other
places I have lived for more than a few consecutive months — in
chronological order: Champaign and Urbana, Illinois; Golden, Colorado;
Kirkland, Redmond, and Seattle, Washington.

I have worked in both research and non-research roles. Currently, I am
living the dream at [Walk Score](https://www.walkscore.com/).

#### Academic Background

##### Pre-Doctoral Biography

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in May 2007. I specialized in scientific
computing and am particularly interested in algorithm and data
structure design and development. My dissertation, titled [Efficient
Setup Algorithms for Parallel Algebraic
Multigrid](/publications/thesis.pdf), focused on parallel coarse grid
selection algorithms for algebraic multigrid (AMG) and was conducted
under the guidance of my advisors Luke Olson and Paul Saylor.

I earned a M.S. in Computer Science at UIUC in 2004 under the guidance
of Paul Saylor. My Masters research was influenced heavily by the work
I did in my first summer at the Center for Applied Scientific
Computing at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

Further back, I earned a B.S. in Biological Science and Computer
Science at the University of Iowa.

##### Post-Doctoral Biography

Shortly after completing my Ph.D., I started a postdoctoral position
in the Scientific Computing Center (now the Materials and
Computational Science Center) at the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado.

My primary project at NREL was part of a computational systems biology
project called “Green Energy: Advancing Bio-hydrogen“. Briefly, the
project aims to: (1) construct a comprehensive metabolic model for the
hydrogen-producing green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; (2) produce
high-performance software for solving problems arising from the rate
equations encoded in the model.

In February 2009 I started a position at Microsoft in which I have
researched topics in numerical linear algebra and other areas of
scientific computing and currently contribute to a math project.
