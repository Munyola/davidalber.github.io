:wave:

My name is David Alber. I am an Engineering Manager for a software
infrastructure team at Redfin. I've been working there since late
2014, starting as a Technical Lead after Redfin acquired Walk Score,
my last employer. Prior to Walk Score I worked at Microsoft for three
years, initially as a Resarch Scientist on an incubator group working
on a high performance linear algebra library for systems with many
cores. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory.

I grew up near Iowa City, Iowa and went to high school and college
there. I attended to graduate school in Urbana, Illinois, spent a
couple years in Golden, Colorado while working in a postdoctoral
position. Now, I live in the Seattle area with my wife and our two
young sons.
