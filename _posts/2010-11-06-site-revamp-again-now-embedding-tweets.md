At the beginning of the year, I [added the right
sidebar](/2010/01/site-revamp/) that contains content from [my Twitter
account](https://twitter.com/DavidAlber/). The motivation was to
automatically capture tweets I make, most of which are retweets
referring to articles I have read. I like that the content is
automatically captured (although a lot ends up being redundant), but I
do not like that it is in a different "stream" than my blog posts. All
of the information is kept in sequence on the feed streams page, but
that is not quite what I want. For instance, there is no way to
comment here about any of those tweets, so for a while I have wanted a
way to get tweets inlined in the blog feed.

Enter [Blackbird
Pie](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-blackbird-pie/),
which learned about yesterday from
[here](http://mashable.com/2010/11/05/wordpress-twitter-blackbird-pie/). This
provides a simple way to embed tweets into posts, keeping the links in
the tweet active. For example:

[blackbirdpie id="29646018950"]

The downside of this is that capturing the tweets is not automated,
but given how I am pulling tweets onto this site and tweeting about
posts here, maybe that is a good thing. Perhaps some day I will find
or write something to implement the cross-posting logic I want, but
for now it is not that big of a burden to do it manually.

Here's the initial plan: I will start embedding tweets, but also will
keep using Lifestream for the right sidebar and the feed streams page
(I am too busy to adjust the site style right now anyway).
