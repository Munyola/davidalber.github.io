I just read [Meteorite hunter: My two months in an Omani
jail](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128190.200-meteorite-hunter-my-two-months-in-an-omani-jail/). It
is an interesting interview about a meteor-hunting trip in Oman that
ended in a prison sentence for Michael Farmer. His comment on risk
jumped out at me.

> **Do you regret your last trip there?**
>
> No. We have had adventures there that money canâ€™t buy. Those of you
  who have never taken a risk cannot understand that those of us who
  gather these stones that fill museums and collections around the
  world knowingly risk life and limb. Those who are unwilling to take
  a risk usually gain little.
