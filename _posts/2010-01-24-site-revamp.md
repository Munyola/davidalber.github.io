I have already hinted that I read many articles that I feel are worth
sharing, but never get around to writing anything about
them. Explanations of this behavior include being busy, lazy, or not
really having much to say, other than something is interesting. As
[described earlier](/2009/11/posting-gap-a-rambling-return/), this
leads to a build up in the various (lame) places that I store the
links. To mitigate this, I have started using
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/) to make small posts about these
interesting articles. That’s all fine and good, but that means my
reader(s) has(ve) to check two places. I preferred the idea of having
all of it in one place, hence the revamp of parts of the site. I am
now using [Lifestream](http://www.enthropia.com/labs/wp-lifestream/)
to pull in my Twitter feed and displaying that in the new, right
sidebar of the blog pages.

Since it has been a while since I messed with
[CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/), I had to tinker around with stuff
for a while to get it right. I found some insight about float elements
[here](http://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/) and got a lot of help
getting my second sidebar in place by looking at [this
example](http://blog.html.it/layoutgala/LayoutGala14.html).

~~Consider this a technical preview for the moment because I have not
modified all of the page templates to work with the new
stylesheets. That’s why the [tags page](/tags/), for example, is
missing its sidebars. I will fix it soon, but I need to move to
another task for now.~~
