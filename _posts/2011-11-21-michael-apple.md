This evening Michael looked at an apple I was eating and said
something that sounded awfully like, "Whatâ€™s that?" Chao-Jen and I
both looked at him and then each other, both surprised. I looked back
at Michael, pointed at the apple, and said, "Apple." Almost
immediately, he responded, "Apple."

He said it a few more times, clearly referring to the apple, although
it did become "bapple" a couple times.

Amazing.

He has said other words (including "owl" when looking at one of his
sippy cups), but this seemed much more interactive.
