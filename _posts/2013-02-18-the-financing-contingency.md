I am writing to you tonight with a rendition of "Skip to my Lou"
playing in the background — children’s music is often the genre of
choice here.

We have been spending some time looking for a home to purchase (our
first). I enjoy the process since I get to learn a lot about something
new to me (I was totally that way during the pregnancy, too).

The Seattle market is very competitive right now, at least in the
neighborhoods we have been targeting. It's not uncommon for homes to
receive multiple offers (say three, four, five, or twelve) before
bidding opens, and of course, the homes are being bid up. The house
then sells immediately (discounting all of the time that passes before
closing). Basically, if you want to get a nice home in these
neighborhoods, you need to see the house before bidding opens, and if
you like the house and want to know if anything is critically wrong
with it before bidding, you need to do a pre-inspection. If your plan
is to do a full inspection after your bid is accepted, don’t expect
your bid to ever be accepted since all of the other bidders have
waived the right to back out of the offer (without penalty) due to
discovered maintenance or safety issues after being under contract.

This leads to the topic of this post: the financing
contingency. Buyers are waiving this too. For the uninitiated: the
financing contingency allows the buyer to get out of the contract
without penalty if they are unable to secure financing (after an
earnest attempt) or if the lender's appraisal of the home comes in
under the offer price. Not waiving this contingency can currently be
the only reason for having an offer beat by a similar offer.

We may be in this situation right now (if you are the seller: we love
your house!): we did not feel comfortable waiving the contingency
because we worry about the implications of appraisal coming in
low. This is not because we have any information to suggest that will
happen, but because are being cautious. We are less worried about our
financing falling through (although that can, of course, happen — even
with pre-approval). For the latter, it falls into the "risk we are
willing to take" bucket, but in a less competitive market we would
feel better being more cautious.

It occurred to me that the financing contingency is really covering
two distinct and different situations. In the case of a buyer
confident in their financing, the concern is appraisal coming in low,
but in the case of a seller the concern is the unknown buyer being
unable to obtain financing. These are both very legitimate concerns,
and it is unfortunate they are put together in one clause. If the
contingency were split into two contingencies we could allay the fears
of a seller by waiving the "obtaining financing" contingency while
keeping the appraisal contingency, which is what we would have done
with our recent offer.
