Fourteen days ago, [Sound Transit](http://www.soundtransit.org/)
opened [Link Light
Rail](http://www.soundtransit.org/Riding-Sound-Transit/Schedules-and-Facilities/Central-Link-Light-Rail.xml),
a light rail line between Tukwila (about 1.5 miles from the airport)
and Downtown Seattle. In December, track covering the final 1.5 miles
to the airport will open providing a direct train link from downtown
to the airport. Trains run every 7.5 minutes at peak and every ten or
fifteen minutes during off-peak hours, depending just how off-peak it
is. Until the track to the airport is opened, shuttles will run
frequently from the Tukwila station to the airport terminal.

Despite my tardiness in writing about it, I have been excited about
this project since I first heard about it, which was months before I
moved here. Since I do not drive to the airport, this is a big step up
personally in convenience in getting there.

The next step, after completion of the line to the airport terminal,
appears to be tunneling 3.15 miles to the University of Washington,
creating the [University
Link](http://www.soundtransit.org/Projects-and-Plans/Projects-By-Service/Link-Light-Rail/University-Link.xml),
which also includes the construction of stations at the University and
on Capitol Hill. Unfortunately, this project will not be completed
until 2016.

In the 2008 General Election, voter approval was given to expand the
light rail service north to Northgate, east across the I-90 bridge to
Redmondâ€™s Overlake Transit Center, and south to the Redondo/Star Lake
area of Federal Way. I have yet to see completion date estimates on
these projects. The same expansion proposal also adds other forms of
transit in other areas, such as more buses across the 520 bridge.
