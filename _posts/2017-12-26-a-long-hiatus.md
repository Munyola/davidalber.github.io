Wow. It's been more than four years since I wrote anything here. A lot
has happened in that time, but before I get to that I want to make a
pact for my readers: in the next year, I will write more here than I
did since 2013. :smirk: Now let's get caught up on the big things that
have happened since 2013.

I'll start with professional changes. The two largest changes have
been being part of an acquisition and transitioning to a leadership
role.
1. Walk Score was acquired by Redfin in late 2014. As a result, I
joined Redfin as a Techincal Lead.
1. Four months after joining Redfin, I transitioned to a management
role and began managing the former Walk Score team. Our team -- Local
Engineering -- was later merged with the Platforms Team, which owns
several areas of developer infrastructure and is focused on making
engineers at Redfin more efficient. Platforms Team has engineers in
Seattle and San Francisco and was recently split into two teams. The
union of these teams own most of what Platforms previously owned. The
manager of the new team reports to me, and I continue to manage the
rest of the team -- now called Engineering Efficiency -- directly.

Personally, the changes have really all been about kids. My second son
was born not too long after my last post before this one. I'm not
going to say more about it, but my kids have kept me busy!

Lots of little things fill in the gaps between the big changes that
have happened, and those -- along with no strong desire to write and
irritation at the software previously driving the site -- have
collaborated to keep me from writing. I'm not sure how active I will
be in the long run, but I have more I want to write for now.
