In the August 2009 edition of the Communications of the ACM, venture
capitalist [Tim Draper argues that now is the
time](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/8/34489-entrepreneurship-during-a-slump/fulltext)
to innovate and try to make something happen. Unfortunately, for you
civilians out there, viewing the articleâ€™s content requires ACM
credentials.

Update: I have discovered that this article is available as a preview
of the digital edition of Communications of the ACM. How lucky;
everyone can view it without credentials
[here](http://mags.acm.org/communications/200908/?pg=26).
