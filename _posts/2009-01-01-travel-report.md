In response to my [earlier post](/2008/12/going-home-tomorrow/) about traveling home, I am happy to report that I made it this year. The trip was not without setbacks, though.

We had some early trouble with loading the plane with the luggage, which was interesting to observe, if anything.

At the other end, however, it was a little frustrating. I was at the destination airport for two hours before going home for a couple reasons. By far the biggest factor was that my (and a couple dozen other peoplesâ€™) carry-on luggage was missing. We were the people that had to drop our carry-on luggage on the jetway, which is not something I normally do, but it seems innocuous enough. I will spare you the details, but a number of people were getting pretty upset.

The return flight earlier this week happened without incident.

It seems that there was a lot of lost and misdirected luggage this year (maybe every year?). My brother had two checked bags lost for a while. One showed up three or four days after flying. The other bag (the one with his clothes) reached Iowa six days after flying, which was the day before he was leaving.

I am just happy that I was able to get home, and with relatively little inconvenience. Also, I got a few through-the-window turkey and deer photos that I will share in a future post, if they look decent enough.
