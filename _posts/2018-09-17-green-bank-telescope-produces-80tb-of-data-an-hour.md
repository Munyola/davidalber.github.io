[SETI neural networks spot dozens of new mysterious signals emanating
from distant
galaxy](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/10/seti-neural-networks-spot-dozens-of-new-mysterious-signals-emanating-from-distant-galaxy/)
reports the use of machine learning to identify 72 new [fast radio
bursts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst) (FRBs) in a
set of data in which 21 FRBs had already been identified using other
methods. What really caught my eye in the article, however, was this:

> Believe it or not, that five-hour session yielded 400 _terabytes_ of
  transmission data.

Wow! I wasn't sure whether to believe that or not. The article also
says "...from a mysteriously noisy galaxy 3 billion miles away were
discovered...", which clearly can't be true since Uranus averages
close to 3 billion miles from the sun. However, a Berkeley article on
this ([AI helps track down mysterious cosmic radio
bursts](http://news.berkeley.edu/2018/09/10/ai-helps-track-down-mysterious-cosmic-radio-bursts/))
also talks about the 400TB data set. Of course, I don't know if that's a typical data volume.

I was hoping to find more information on volumes of data collected by
radio telescopes. The first thing that I discovered was from [SKA
telescope to generate more data than entire Internet in
2020](https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/392735/ska_telescope_generate_more_data_than_entire_internet_2020/). From that article:

> The project is expected to deliver up to an exabyte a day of raw
  data, compressed to some 10 petabytes of data in images for storage.

:astonished:
