On the way home on the [Burke-Gilman
Trail](https://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/burke-gilman-trail)
tonight a cyclist traveling in the opposite direction angrily yelled
"e-bike!"  at me. According to Strava, I was going somewhere between
11 and 12 mph at the time. The other cyclist -- by my judgement at the
time -- was going a little faster than I was. :bicyclist:

Moving past whatever that was about, I decided to look at what the
current situation with e-bikes on trails is. Here's what I found:

- A Washington State law signed earlier this year defined classes of
  e-bikes. Our Packster 80 is a Class 1 e-bike. The new law is
  summarized in [this
  article](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/new-law-sets-standards-rules-for-using-e-bikes/).

  > Class 1 and Class 2 bicycles can operate on a "shared-use path or
    any part of a highway designated for the use of bicycles," the
    bill says. However, local jurisdictions and state agencies may
    impose their own additional limitations.

- As for the question of limitations imposed by Seattle, a pilot
  program started recently. From ["E-bikes Coming to Seattle Multi-Use
  Trails"](https://seattletransitblog.com/2018/04/28/e-bikes-coming-seattle-multi-use-trails/):

  > The pilot, which runs through Summer of 2019, will allow for Class
    1 and 2 e-bikes to ride the trails at speeds of up to 15mph.

My son asked me if 15 mph is too fast. I told him that it depends on
the presence of other trail users (particularly pedestrians) and clear
sight lines forward and to the sides. I adjust my speed to keep it
safe for me, my passengers, and others around us.
