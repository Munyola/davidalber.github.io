Here's one of the articles I have in my backlog of items to share; it
is from a while back.

Back in December, a respectably large cache of garden gnomes was
discovered in a Mount Vernon, Washington resident’s back yard when
high winds knocked down her fence. The fence was concealing around
sixty yard gnomes — at least some apparently stolen from other yards
-— along with other yard ornaments. See the link for more details.
