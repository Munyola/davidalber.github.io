A few posts back, I promised (with conditions) some deer and turkey photos from my trip home last month. Here they are!

The turkeys below come by the house several times a day and eat seed that has been pushed out of a bird feeder by other birds. The tom whose photo I posted back in September (see [Tom Turkey](/2008/09/tom-turkey/)) still visits regularly, but is, of course, traveling alone. A few times, however, they were all together outside the house.

A deer and representatives of two species of squirrels.

Finally, I have received word that two coyotes have been seen nearby multiple times.
