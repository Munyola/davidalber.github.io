The [2018 Rust Annual
Survey](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/11/27/Rust-survey-2018.html)
results are out. All of it was interesting to read through it, but I
was interested to see the questions around adoption in the
workplace. I'm not sure what it is about Rust, but I like the language
and the community around it. I sort of feel like I am part of it, even
though I'm really a leaf node.

The parts of the [associated Hacker News
thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18544213) that I read
were interesting to me. [This
comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18545373) from Steve
Klabnik is a nice rundown of current production use cases of
Rust. From that I learned that AWS just released [a new virtualization
technology called
Firecracker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/firecracker-lightweight-virtualization-for-serverless-computing/)
that is written in Rust.
