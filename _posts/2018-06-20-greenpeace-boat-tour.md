By request, I was taking the boys to the Science Center on Father's
Day. We were on the Packster and I saw a Greenpeace ship in South Lake
Union. Tours were being hosted on board! It's not often that I have a
chance to tour an ocean-going ship, but the boys resisted and we moved
on.

Fortunately for me, they are doing the tours again this weekend! Check
out the details
[here](https://www.facebook.com/events/192760711545030/). I think I'll
have better luck this weekend.

The ship is the Arctic Sunrise, which you can learn more about
