In my last post I wrote about [our new
bike](/2018/03/new-bike-day-packster-80/). It was a beautiful day
today, and we got some good time in on the bike.

Before I forget about it, I wanted to write about the process of
taking possession of the bike from the shop. It was more like taking
possession of a car from a dealership than my previous new bike
experiences. We received two manuals inside a Riese & MÃ¼ller branded
canvas folder and six keys. The checkout process included several
pages in the manual that the bike shop filled out and both I and the
person at the bike shop signed. Finally, the manual includes a
maintenance schedule.
