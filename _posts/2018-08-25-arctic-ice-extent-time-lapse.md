It's not going to come as a surprise to anyone paying attention that
the amount of arctic sea ice is decreasing, but reading about it is
not always as compelling as seeing relevant visualizations. Below are
a couple time lapse videos showing arctic ice extent and ice age from
1990 through 2016.

They are both narrated and based on the same data.

The gist of it is that the maximum age of arctic ice -- and maximum
thickness, as older ice tends to be thicker -- has declined
dramatically in the last thirty years. A big factor in this has been
the warming of the Beaufort Sea, which contains the Beaufort Gyre, a
nursery for old sea ice.
