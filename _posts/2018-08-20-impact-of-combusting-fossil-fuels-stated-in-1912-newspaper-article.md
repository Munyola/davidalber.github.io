[article](https://www.businessinsider.com/newspaper-in-1912-linked-coal-to-climate-change-2018-8)
in Business Insider this week marked the 106th anniversary since a
newspaper in New Zealand published a four-sentence article titled

recently made-up thing it was a little jarring to see it summed up so
clearly so long ago. Some might wonder if this was really published
106 years ago. According to Snopes, [it
