I do not know if this is normal around here, but I am frequently
discovering and having to deal with spiders in my apartment. Me being
me, I catch and release these spiders, which have been ranging from
pretty small to one exceptionally large spider that required a
substitution in my usual capturing device (a glass) due to its size. I
currently have one trapped underneath my desk and will be relocating
it outdoors in a few moments.
