A coworker sent me a link to a transcript of an interesting talk titled “[You and Your Research](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)” that was delivered by [Richard Hamming](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hamming.html) in 1986. It contains observations made and opinions formed by Hamming over his career — particularly the portion of his career at Bell Labs — about how to be a successful (or unsuccessful) scientist.
