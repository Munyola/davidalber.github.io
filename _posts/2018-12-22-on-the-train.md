We boarded the train this afternoon in Seattle and will ride for at
least thirty-seven hours before reaching Minneapolis.

Our berth is not huge, but it's large enough for the four of us. It
spans the width of the car, so we are not elbow to elbow, or anything
like that.

We passed through Wenatchee a little while ago. The train stopped long
enough for us to get out briefly. It was snowing.

I'm looking foward to seeing Glacier National Park tomorrow morning!
