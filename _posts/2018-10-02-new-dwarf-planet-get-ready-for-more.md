The discovery of 2015 TG387, a new dwarf planet nicknamed "The
Goblin", was announced today. According to a [Carnegie Institution for
Science press release](https://carnegiescience.edu/node/2403), this
object's closest approach to the sun (perihelion) is about 65 AU; a
little more than double Pluto's perihelion. However, its orbit is
highly elliptical, and its aphelion is about 35x further. The story
here fits into a puzzle about a hypothetical ninth planet in the far
outer solar system.

> The location in the sky where 2015 TG387 reaches perihelion is
  similar to 2012 VP113, Sedna, and most other known extremely distant
  trans-Neptunian objects, suggesting that something is pushing them
  into similar types of orbits.

The Goblin was discovered at about 80 AU, but it is not observable
from Earth during most of its orbit. Instead of believing that this
was complete luck, there is some suspicion that there's a lot of
extreme dwarf planets.

> "We think there could be thousands of small bodies like 2015 TG387
  out on the Solar System's fringes, but their distance makes finding
  them very difficult," Tholen said. "Currently we would only detect
  2015 TG387 when it is near its closest approach to the Sun. For some
  99 percent of its 40,000-year orbit, it would be too faint to see."

Get ready for more!
