I have long been a fan of the products at [Despair.com](http://despair.com/) — starting first with the Demotivators, some of which I find really funny (and true!) — and have known about the [Made in USA by Robots](http://despair.com/collections/t-shirts/products/made-in-usa-by-robots) t-shirt for a while (I find it hilarious). I saw the t-shirt  in person for a first time a few days ago at work. I was a little surprised, but in retrospect probably should not have been. If I had seen someone wearing it at NREL that would have been a surprise.
