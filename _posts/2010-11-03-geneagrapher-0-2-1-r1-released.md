Version 0.2.1-r1, a maintenance release, of the Geneagrapher is now
available.

A few tests in Geneagrapher 0.2.1 have become broken since that
version was released. This release fixes those tests, but does not
change the functionality from version 0.2.1. Existing installations
need not install this release.

For more information, please see the [Geneagrapher
page](/geneagrapher/) and the [Geneagrapher 0.2.1 release
announcement](/2009/09/geneagrapher-021-released/).
