A new Chinese supercomputer -— Tianhe-1A -— has achieved 2.5 petaflops
on the LINPACK benchmark. Not bad! Jaguar was at 1.75 petaflops in
June’s [Top500](https://www.top500.org/) list. More information
[here](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/technology/28compute.html).

One interesting point, according to the article above, is that the
machine has a Chinese-developed network that operates at twice the
speed of Infiniband.

I recall when the Earth Simulator came out and perceived a sense of
surprise and urgency from certain groups due to the top machine not
being in the United States. In this case, it is less of a surprise,
but it would be interesting to see how people respond.
