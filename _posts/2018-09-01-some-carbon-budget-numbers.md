The Keeling Curve shows that there is currently 406 parts per million
(ppm) of atmospheric carbon dioxide at Hawaii's Mauna Loa
Observatory. The highest concentration over the last year was a little
above 410 ppm. It was around 340 ppm when I was born.

It's believed that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has not
been this high for 3-20 million years. Below is the view for the last
800,000 years. Compare the slope of the last few decades to the rest
of the record.

Random: how much CO<sub>2</sub> is a ppm? It's around 7.8 gigatons of
CO<sub>2</sub>.

Net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are around forty gigatons per year right
now. That averages to a little more than 2.5 million pounds per
second. It's hard to imagine how much this is, so let's think about it
in terms of [Saturn V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V)
rockets. The Saturn V was the largest rocket ever launched and was
used to send humans to the moon. A fueled Saturn V weighed 6,540,000
pounds, which is 3,270 tons. Thus, 40 gigatons is around 12.2 million
Saturn Vs of mass. We are adding 12.2 million Saturn V rockets of
CO<sub>2</sub> mass per year to the atmosphere.
