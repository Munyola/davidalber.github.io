[Fandible](http://www.fandible.com/) is a roleplaying podcast with a
cast of players playing a variety of games. I've been listening to
their [Numenera Longshot episodes](http://www.fandible.com/longshot/)
and really enjoy it. I haven't played Numenera, although I want to
try. It is interesting to listen to a group tabletop roleplaying, and
I also enjoy the storytelling.

The Longshot has been going on for about 2.5 years, which is really
impressive to me. They are up to 103 episodes at this time, and I'm
still way behind. At the rate I am going, though, it won't be too long
before I am caught up.
