"[Dream of solar sailing in space lives on in new
project](http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/2009/1111/dream-of-solar-sailing-in-space-lives-on-in-new-project)"
discusses an announcement by [The Planetary
Society](http://www.planetary.org/) to build, launch, and test
[LightSail-1](http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/solar_sailing/lightsail1.html)
â€” a small craft that will be propelled by solar sail. As explained in
the article, previous attempts to launch solar sail craft failed.

I have always been intrigued by the solar sail concept (I am intrigued
by a lot of things, though) and will try to keep an eye on this.
