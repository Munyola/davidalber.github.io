I enjoyed reading this article: [Beekeeping as a
Business](http://eatdrinkbetter.com/2011/09/19/beekeeping-as-a-business/). It
is short and describes a little on how to get started in beekeeping
(or rather how to learn more about getting started), about how the
hobby can easily turn into a business on the side after a while, and
some of the products that come from beehives. Also, I learned that
every state has a bee inspector.

So am I about to set up a hive or two of my own? I donâ€™t think the HOA
in the condo complex where we rent would be happy with me housing
hundreds of bees thirty feet from the community pool. Maybe
later. Still, attending "beekeeping school" might be interesting to
learn something new.
