I've been looking at more catboats. I wrote about [large
catboats](/2018/07/large-catboats/) at the end of last month and am
now curious about what else is out there. There's [The Catboat
Association](https://www.catboats.org/), for starters. So far I only
looked through the cats for sale, which led me to another
builder. Marshall Cats are are built by [Marshall Marine
Corp.](https://www.marshallcat.com/) Their catboats are built with
fiberglass hulls, unlike the other builders I mentioned before.

There are a few other builders represented in the cats for sale. I'll
probably look more into those later.

So far as I can tell (and already believed), most of the catboat
action is on the east coast.
