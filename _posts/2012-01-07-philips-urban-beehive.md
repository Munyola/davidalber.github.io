A [few posts back](/2011/09/beekeeping-my-new-hobby/), I was talking
about beekeeping. Shortly afterwards, I saw a
[couple](http://www.greenprophet.com/2011/11/urban-beehive-philips/)
[articles](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/114145-Urban-Beehive-Brings-Bees-Indoors)
about a [Philips urban
beehive](http://www.design.philips.com/philips/sites/philipsdesign/about/design/designportfolio/design_futures/design_probes/projects/microbial_home/urban_beehive.page). Click
through one of those links for images.

I kind of wonder about cleaning the thing, but bees are pretty
obsessive about hygiene, so maybe there is no issue. Let me know how
it goes.

This beehive is part of the companyâ€™s [Microbial Home design
project](http://www.newscenter.philips.com/main/design/news/press/2011/Philips_launches%20_Microbial_Home_new_forward_looking_design_concepts.wpd).
