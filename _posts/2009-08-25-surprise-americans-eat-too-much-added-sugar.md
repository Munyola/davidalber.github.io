The [American Heart Association](http://http//www.americanheart.org/)
has [reminded
us](http://americanheart.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=800) again
that Americans consume a lot of added sugar each day. Between 2001 and
2004, Americans consumed, on average, twenty-two teaspoons of added
sugar daily. The recommended limits? For men: nine teaspoons, and
women: six teaspoons.

[This
article](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32543288/ns/health-diet_and_nutrition/)
claims that teenagers eat thirty-four teaspoons of added sugar daily,
on average. It also has some other interesting information, such as
the amount of sugar that “fruit-flavored” yogurt contains: six
teaspoons.

And to put this into a unit that actually helps you: [one teaspoon of
sugar is about 4.2
grams](http://nutrition.about.com/od/askyournutritionist/f/gramconversion.htm).
