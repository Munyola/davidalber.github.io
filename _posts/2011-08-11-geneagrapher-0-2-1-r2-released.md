Version 0.2.1-r2, a maintenance release, of the Geneagrapher is now
available.

A test in Geneagrapher 0.2.1-r1 was broken by new information added to
the [Mathematics Genealogy
Project](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/). This release
fixes the test, but does not change the functionality from version
0.2.1-r1. Existing installations need not install this release.

For more information, please see the [Geneagrapher](/geneagrapher/)
page and the [Geneagrapher 0.2.1-r1 release
announcement](/2010/11/geneagrapher-0-2-1-r1-released/).
