We made it back to Seattle tonight. We left my parents house yesterday
and stayed in a hotel in Des Moines. Today we drove to Kansas City and
got a direct flight back to Seattle. We were justified in taking this
long drive to an airport, but I'm too tired to write about it.

Also, we have friends that live not too far from Kansas City that we
failed to see over the break. We need to take advantage of the direct
flight sometime to see them.
