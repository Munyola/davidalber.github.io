[Going Nowhere Fast on Climate, Year After
Year](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/opinion/climate-change-global-warming-history.html)
contains a high-level summary of the last thirty years of climate
change discovery, policy, coordinated denial, and recent rollbacks by
the climate change deniers in the Executive Branch. It's worth reading
through the entire piece. Here is a selection of some of the points:

1997:
> More than 1,500 scientists from 63 countries, including 110 Nobel
  Prize winners, issue [a call to
  action](https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/solutions/reduce-emissions/world-scientists-call-for.html#.W89l6mJKi3I):
  "A broad consensus among the world's climatologists is that there is
  now a discernible human influence on global climate" that represents
  "one of the most serious threats to the planet and to future
  generations."

2000:
> In the presidential campaign, George W. Bush, the Republican
  nominee, [promises to
  cut](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/13/world/2-weeks-starting-today-argue-fine-crucial-details-cutting-greenhouse-gas.html)
  carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, while Al Gore, the
  Democratic candidate, calls for aggressive climate policies but does
  not make climate change a major campaign issue and [mentions it only
  once](http://www.debates.org/?page=october-11-2000-debate-transcript)
  in the debates.

2001:
> Under strong pressure from conservative Republicans and industry
  groups, President Bush says his administration will not seek to
  regulate emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants, reversing a
  campaign pledge.

2003:
> The Senate [votes 55 to 43 against a
  bill](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/31/us/senate-defeats-climate-bill-but-proponents-see-silver-lining.html)
  sponsored by Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, and
  Senator Joe Lieberman, a Democrat from Connecticut, to limit carbon
  dioxide emissions by creating a market-driven "cap and trade"
  program. Only four Republicans vote yes.

> The Republican campaign adviser Frank Luntz [writes a
  memo](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/02/us/a-call-for-softer-greener-language.html)
  to party officials noting: "Should the public come to believe that
  the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming
  will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the
  lack of scientific certainty a primary issue."

2004:
> Climate scientists across the globe [overwhelming
  agree](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/306/5702/1686) that
  evidence of climate change is clear and persuasive, according to a
  detailed analysis in Science Magazine by the science historian Naomi
  Oreskes. As she puts it: "Many details about climate interactions
  are not well understood, and there are ample grounds for continued
  research to provide a better basis for understanding climate
  dynamics. The question of what to do about climate change is also
  still open. But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of
  anthropogenic climate change. Climate scientists have repeatedly
  tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen."

2009:
> The House of Representatives passes [a cap-and-trade
  bill](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/27/us/politics/27climate.html)
  that would require cuts in greenhouse gas emissions of 17 percent
  below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Only eight
  Republicans vote yes. The bill never receives a vote in the Senate,
  even though Democrats control 57 seats and two independents caucus
  with them.

Perhaps the Democrats were not as sincere about addressing the problem
as they were in appearing to want to address the problem.

> The American Petroleum Institute, funded by major oil companies,
  helps [organize and
  pay](https://www.newsweek.com/how-grassroots-organizing-has-been-co-opted-78589)
  for the first Tea Party rallies, including protests against the
  House-passed cap-and-trade legislation.

2012:
> In his acceptance speech to become the Republican presidential
  nominee, Mitt Romney mocks President Obama’s climate efforts:
  "President Obama promised to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal
  the planet. My promise is to help you and your family."

2013:
> In his second Inaugural Address, President Obama calls climate
  change the [leading issue of our
  time](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/us/politics/climate-change-prominent-in-obamas-inaugural-address.html?module=inline). "We
  will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that failure
  to do so would betray our children and future generations."

2016:
> 2016 is the [warmest year on
  record](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201613), the third
  consecutive year that a global annual temperature record has been
  set, and the 40th consecutive year that annual temperatures have
  been above the 20th-century average. The five warmest years have all
  occurred since 2010.

> Nearly all of the 16 Republican presidential hopefuls [deny the
  science of climate
  change](https://newrepublic.com/article/124381/2016-presidential-candidates-view-climate-change),
  and none support the Paris climate agreement. Donald Trump pledges
  to "cancel" American involvement in the Paris accord.

2017:
> Hurricane Harvey unleashes 50 inches of rain, [the largest
  rainfall](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/us/hurricane-harvey-storm-flooding.html)
  in United States history, paralyzing five million in Houston,
  killing 30, with a price tag of at least tens of billions of dollars
  to federal taxpayers. Multiple peer-reviewed studies find that
  Hurricane Harvey was made as much as 40 percent larger and more
  intense because of warming Gulf of Mexico waters tied to the
  changing climate.

2018:
> Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reach 410 parts
  per million, [the highest
  level](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-just-breached-the-410-ppm-threshold-for-co2/)
  in at least three million years.

> President Trump insists coal [is the
  key](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/390270-trump-orders-perry-to-take-immediate-steps-to-stop-coal-plant)
  to the country’s energy and economic future and orders Energy
  Secretary Rick Perry to take immediate steps to prevent market
  shutdowns of coal plants.

> The Trump administration says it will [roll back fuel economy
  standards](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/climate/trump-climate-emissions-rollback.html)
  set by the Obama administration for cars and light trucks, a move
  that would increase greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by
  an amount greater than many midsize countries put out in a year.

> After falling for more than a decade, carbon dioxide emissions in
  the United States are [set to
  rise](https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/12/05/we-are-trouble-global-carbon-emissions-reached-new-record-high/)
  by 2.5 percent in 2018. Global emissions grew by 1.6 percent in 2017
  and will increase by about 2.7 percent in 2018.

It will take real leadership to create and focus the will to do
something about climate change. The warnings we receive from
scientists are increasingly dire, yet we continue to do nothing. The
current trajectory is not encouraging, and [the twelve-year window to
do
something](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/world-was-just-issued-12-year-ultimatum-climate-change-180970489/)
is a tall order, especially in the United States, given the level of
scientific illiteracy (or perhaps just congnitive dissonance) and
corruption among our national leaders. As long as we have leaders that
are willfully ignorant and pursue counterproductive policies it will
be impossible to address this crisis. That said, I remain hopeful that
we can find leadership and willpower to give us a chance to find
solutions to the very difficult problems we face before they become
completely overwhelming.
