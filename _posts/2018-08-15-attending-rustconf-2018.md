I'm excited to be attending [RustConf](https://rustconf.com/) this
week. I hope to come away with a better feeling of what the community
is like, as well as perhaps learning enough about Rust to level up my
skills with it. It's actually been a couple months since I wrote any
substantial amount of Rust (I'm still maintaining some of my Rust code
and working through the last chapters of The Rust Book), but I really
hope to get back to it at some level.
