The work that I did as a member of the Math Libraries Group in
Technical Computing at Microsoft has been released in the form of a
SQL Azure Lab named [Microsoft Codename "Cloud
Numerics"](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlazurelabs/labs/numerics.aspx). There
is, of course, a lot of other technology in the lab that was not
produced by my group, but all of our product is in the release.
