Now that I am getting more serious about using my bike, I am ready to
begin exploring phase two: events. Although I lived in Iowa for 20+
years, I never had the desire to do RAGBRAI while I was there. I am
now thinking that I would like to do it sometime (add it to the list
of things I want to do eventually).

For those not in the know, [RAGBRAI](http://ragbrai.com/) — the
Register’s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa — is an annual,
organized, week-long bike ride across Iowa. They [announced this
year’s
route](http://ragbrai.com/index.php/2010/01/30/overnight-towns-announced-2010-ragbrai-is-one-of-shortest-flatest-ever/)
tonight:

> RAGBRAI XXXVIII will treat riders to one of the shortest and
> flattest routes ever as it winds through northern Iowa from Sioux
> City to Dubuque.
>
> That combination means the 10,000 riders will navigate a 442-mile
> route that ranks as third-easiest historically, at least as far as
> hills and mileage go. Weather remains a wild card. So train well.

It happens in late July.

So, who’s with me?
