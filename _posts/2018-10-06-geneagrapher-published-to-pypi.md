More than ten years :gasp: since rewriting Geneagrapher (see a post
about that [here](/2008/08/geneagrapher-development/)), I have
published it to PyPI. Check out the [Geneagrapher on
PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/geneagrapher/)!

I was motivated to do this after being contacted by a person who is
interested in installing and using the Geneagrapher. It made more
sense to make that possible through the usual Python package
management system than directing users to clone the repository and
install from source.

It's surprising, but Geneagrapher has basically continued working all
of that time. Since Geneagrapher needs to scrape its data, this is
thanks to the [Math Genealogy
Project](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu) not changing the
structure of its pages.
