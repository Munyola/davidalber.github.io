Well, the past few weeks have been filled with a variety of activities. First, I was gone to a conference in Austin, as discussed in earlier posts. Then I came back to Colorado for half a week before traveling to Seattle for a few days over Thanksgiving weekend. After returning, my brother came to visit for five days and we spent a couple of those days skiing.

I expect to be in Colorado until Christmas, although it is possible that will change on short notice. You can look forward to a future post containing photos of bighorn sheep that I saw while on a mission in the foothills. Additionally, I am planning a follow-up post on the bats in Austin. Some bats were still living under the bridge, and I managed to capture a few photos. It was pretty dark, however, necessitating a long exposure. You will see what I mean later.
