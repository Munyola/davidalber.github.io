The Meadows Field Airport in Bakersfield, California was shutdown on
Tuesday by bottles of honey. They did not know they were dealing with
honey at the time. From "[Bottled Honey Shuts Down California
Airport](http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/Bottled-Honey-Shuts-Down-California-Airport-80748572.html)"
in VOANews:

> Two Transportation Security Administration officers were also
  treated and released from the hospital after being exposed to what
  were described as "fumes" from the bottles.
