Next Monday I start a new job at [Walk
Score](https://www.walkscore.com/), a Seattle startup that promotes
walkability by producing a measure incorporating information on nearby
businesses and attractions. You can learn more about the company
[here](https://www.walkscore.com/about.shtml).

From a mission standpoint, the appeal of this company to me is obvious
to anyone that knows me well. I care a lot about resource consumption
issues (which is what initially attracted me to the [National
Renewable Energy Laboratory](http://www.nrel.gov/) for my postdoc),
having a good commute (good to me is being able to conveniently reach
work by transit, foot, or bike), and having tools to assist in finding
a home that has sufficient nearby attractions. I like the languages
and tools used at Walk Score, and this job is going to give me an
opportunity to learn a bunch of new technologies. I will be making
contributions that are visible and are valuable to the company, and my
contributions will be used by a large number of users every day (a
number that I intend to help grow), which I find very motivating.

Also, don’t forget that I really enjoy compelling and informative
visualization. I like Walk Score’s heat maps (here’s Seattle)!

As for my commute: I had a pretty good set up for my job at
Microsoft. I was walking to work daily since I live just down the
hill. Since Walk Score is in Seattle (and I live in Redmond) it is a
more complicated. I will start on a bike and bus commute and expect
that to work pretty well for me most of the time.
