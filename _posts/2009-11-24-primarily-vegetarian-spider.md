I have for a long time been fascinated by the [symbiotic relationship
between some species of acacias and
ants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacia#Symbiosis). Honestly, I have
also for a long time been fascinated by ants alone. Now some
researchers have observed interesting behavior by a species of jumping
spider, [_Bagheera
kiplingi_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagheera_kiplingi), that lives
on the same acacia plants.

In many of these ant-plant relationships, the ants are provided food
-— called [Beltian bodies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltian_body)
-— by the acacia plant. The researchers observed the spider
B. kiplingi “hunting” and eating the Beltian bodies as its primary
source of food, making this spider the first known to have a primarily
vegetarian diet.

Read a summary of the research
[here](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=vegetarian-spider). The
research manuscript is at
[doi:10.1016/j.cub.2009.08.049](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2009.08.049),
