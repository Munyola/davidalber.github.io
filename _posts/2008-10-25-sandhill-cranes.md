A couple weeks ago, I was in my garage and heard a group of birds that sounded completely foreign to me. I eventually located the source: it was what appeared to be several dozen migrating geese. I thought they were geese because they were in the usual ‘V’ formation (three or four ‘V’s, in fact). At the time, I had no idea what species they were, but because of their call, I knew they were not [Canada Geese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Goose), which is pretty much all I see around here.

I intended to figure this out by listening to goose audio clips, but luckily, I never did. I say luckily because that would have been a fruitless effort -- they were not geese at all. I saw a short clip on the news yesterday about [Sandhill Cranes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhill_Crane) and immediately recognized the sound.

The groups I had seen were far too high up for me to recognize they were not geese (if nothing else, the legs would have given it away). I had never seen in person or heard Sandhill Cranes before, but I doubt I will have any difficulty identifying their call in the future.

An audio clip of Sandhill Cranes in flight (plus a crow) is available [here](http://www.iwoodfish.com/Soundfiles/sandhill%20soundtrack.mov).
