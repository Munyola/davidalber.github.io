In response to yesterday’s wholly unnecessary assault on my shoe (see [Berry Stains from the Sky](/2009/07/berry-stains-from-the-sky/)), I have decided to memorialize the event in haiku.

![Crow-delivered berry stains on shoe]({{ site.image_base }}/shoe-berry-stains.jpg)

In the first poem, I write from what I imagine to be the perspective of the assaulting crow.

> summer is most fun<br/>
> eating berries in the tree<br/>
> poop on humans’ heads

The second poem describes the event from my perspective, starting with the crows on the ground, followed by the realization that they were distracting for the attacker from above.

> young crows in the park<br/>
> diversion! third crow in tree!<br/>
> they laugh, stain my shoe
