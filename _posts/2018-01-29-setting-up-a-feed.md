My site has an Atom feed [here](/feed.xml), and it was super easy to
set up on GitHub Pages. I added a new plugin to the site's _config.yml
file in
[77cab7c](https://github.com/davidalber/davidalber.github.io/commit/77cab7cc1e48e46e8c605acd54ccaa4aea930b8a),
per the directions
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/atom-rss-feeds-for-github-pages/). Jekyll
did the rest.
