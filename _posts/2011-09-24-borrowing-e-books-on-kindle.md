It is now possible to check out e-books from some libraries on the
Kindle (see [Amazon's Kindle Gets a Library
Card](https://www.wired.com/2011/09/how-to-check-out-library-books-for-kindle/)). This
is not available at all libraries; you can see if your library has
this service [here](http://search.overdrive.com/) (click on "Library
Search").

The [King County Library System](http://www.kcls.org/) offers [e-book
check out](http://overdrive.downloads.kcls.org/) for the Kindle.
