I have known for years about the existence of a bridge (the “bat bridge”, or more formally the [Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_W._Richards_Congress_Avenue_Bridge)) in Austin that is home to around a million bats (it turns out that it is approximately 750,000 bats in the spring — mostly females — who nearly double the population before the end of summer through reproduction).

I know precious little else about Austin’s “highlights” except the bat bridge, but believe me, that is enough to make me want to go there. How convenient I will be there next week (see [In Austin, Texas Next Week](/2008/11/in-austin-texas-next-week/)).

As part of the preparation for the trip last night, I determined the location of the bat bridge. Imagine my exuberance when I realized my hotel is less than one block from this landmark! For a time, it nearly felt as if it was fate guiding my journey toward the bat bridge.

Unfortunately, fate is cruel and reality pulled the rug out from under me. The bats vacate the bridge at the end of fall (sometime in October, I gather) and head south. I suppose seeing the bridge without the bats will still be enjoyable, but it clearly will not be the same.
