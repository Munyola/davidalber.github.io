I've been enjoying watching [Playing & Writing Stories with Shanna
Germain and Charles Ryan](https://youtu.be/RlfqZvwW8Tc). Shanna and
Charles (and the host, Darcy) are members of [Monte Cook
Games](https://www.montecookgames.com/), a tabletop roleplaying game
company. I've additionally been occasionally reading the Numenera core
book and watching videos of MCG employees playing.

It was interesting listening to Shanna and Charles talk about writing
stories, writing for roleplaying games, and how their processes
differ. I enjoyed learning about tools they use, and the one that
caught my attention the most is
[Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/). I'd like
to try it out, but it's a little odd to want to write to use a tool
rather than use a tool to help you write. Not that that will stop me.

I really enjoyed Shanna saying that she does what she loves for a
living. Similarly, Charles said working in the game business is
fantastic and he's grateful to work in a company where he's able to
help shape the priorities and values. Although I don't know Shanna or
Charles, I find their happiness doing this work uplifting.
