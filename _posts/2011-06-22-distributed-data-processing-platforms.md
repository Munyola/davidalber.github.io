I just started looking at distributed data processing platforms. There
is, of course, the [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) project,
but I have also come across [HPCC Systems](https://hpccsystems.com/),
a system used by [LexusNexus Risk
Solutions](http://www.lexisnexis.com/risk/), and
[Disco](http://discoproject.org/), a system developed by [Nokia
Research Center](http://research.nokia.com/).
