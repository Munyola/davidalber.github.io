We went kayaking last Sunday. This was the first time I have been kayaking. It was pretty fun and was definitely good exercise.

The kayaks were rented in Lake Union at the [Northwest Outdoor Center](http://www.nwoc.com/). We headed over to the Arboretum (in a double kayak). In the Arboretum we saw, at close range, a Great Blue Heron, a duck with many ducklings in tow, and a lot of turtles (mostly Red-Eared Sliders, I think). These are marked on the map by white, red, and yellow circles, respectively. The Great Blue Heron even caught a fish when we were there. Unfortunately, I did not get good pictures of any wildlife.

After touring around the Arboretum for a while, we headed back. Estimates place the route at a little more than seven miles.
