For all of you out there who are wondering where I will be from
February 24, 2010 through February 26, 2010, I have your answer: I
will be at the [SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific
Computing (PP10)](http://www.siam.org/meetings/pp10/). The conference
is being held in Seattle, so really, I will be pretty much where I
would have been anyway.

Let me know if you want to meet there.
