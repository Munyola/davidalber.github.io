This is not of general interest, but for anyone who wonders,
[A320](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320_family) lavatories
have better baby changing tables than
[737](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737) lavatories. If your
baby is under five or six months, it probably does not matter, but the
737 table is really short. This somewhat redeems the A320 for me.
