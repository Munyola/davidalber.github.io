I [last wrote](/2018/10/fandible-numenera-podcast/) about
[Fandible](http://www.fandible.com/) in the context of their [Numenera
Longshot podcast](http://www.fandible.com/longshot/). Well, a few
months ago I finally caught up with their latest episode. That was
after being able to listen to the 100+ episodes at whatever pace I
wanted, so it was kind of like hitting a brick wall. I waited for new
episodes, but I ultimately cracked. Now they've got me hooked on their
[Soloshot](http://www.fandible.com/soloshot/), which is run using
FFG's [Force and Destiny
rulebook](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-force-and-destiny/).

The podcast is just two people: a GM and one player. I never imagined
a setup like that could work so well, but they are amazing. It
probably helps that I really like the Star Wars setting, but Angela
and Billy put so much depth into the story and characters.

The Longshot is releasing new episodes again, so now they've got me
hooked on two shows.
