[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) "is a
month-long celebration of open source software". The idea is to
contribute, via PRs, to public projects hosted on GitHub. In addition
to the good feeling of contributing to a project and learning, some
people that contribute at least five PRs will receive a
t-shirt. Sounds like fun!
