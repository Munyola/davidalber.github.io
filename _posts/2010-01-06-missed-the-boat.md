I plan to add new memory to my desktop machine around the time I
install Windows 7. A few months ago I checked the price on two more
DIMMs of the same type that are already in the machine: $32 at the
time. I should have bought then because they are now up to $50. Oh,
well.

The cause for the upward shift? The general sentiment seems to be
simple supply and
demand. [Some](http://www.overclock.net/intel-memory/590946-ddr2-prices-gone-up.html)
have it as demand for DDR2 has fallen, and
[others](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/264632-30-memory-expensive-past-months)
have it as the supply was too high.

I have decided not to wait and get it now.
