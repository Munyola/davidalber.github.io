I received a [book about
orienteering](https://www.amazon.com/Orienteering-Sport-Navigating-Map-Compass/dp/0811728706)
over the holidays (I had requested it). My trip back to Washington
from Iowa last week was long enough, due to a four hour wait for the
connecting flight, for me to get through the book.

Conveniently, there was an [orienteering event in Seattle
yesterday](http://cascadeoc.org/events/2012/winter-o-series-5wiol-5-shoreview-park),
and I went (results
[here](http://cascadeoc.org/results/2012/winter-o-series-5wiol-5)). This
was my first event, so I ran the beginner course. I liked it and plan
to continue attending events. I think the sport will be really
interesting on more challenging courses because of the decision making
that will go into navigating to the controls.

Back to the book: it would benefit from updating and releasing a new
edition. The basic information is still accurate, but parts of the
book have become outdated, based on what I saw and learned from
talking to an experienced club member.
