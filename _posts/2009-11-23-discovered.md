I was confronted this weekend by a friend -— let’s call him "Kiran" -—
who was faux-irritated that I never told him about this blog. Sorry
about that, and I am also sorry to anyone else who has landed here and
felt similarly. This whole thing started as an experiment, and I
believe I only told two people about the blog (one being my mom).

Here are possible explanations for having never advertised this:

- The blog never left experiment mode.
- I did not think it would appeal to a wider audience.
- I was too lazy to say anything.
