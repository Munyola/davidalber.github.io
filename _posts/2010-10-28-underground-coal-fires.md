There are thousands of underground coal fires around the world and
more than one hundred in the United States (see [Deep Underground,
Miles of Hidden Wildfires
Rage](http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2006195,00.html)). Most
of these fires start due to mining activities, but some fires started
are ignited naturally. They are difficult to extinguish, and can burn
for years, decades, or longer. Amazingly, there is naturally-occurring
coal fire in Australia that is believed to have burning for 6000 years
so far (see [Burning
Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Mountain))*. According
to the article linked above, some scientists estimate that three
percent of the annual coal emissions are caused by these fires, but
they admit there is a lot of room for error in their estimates.

*Pretty unrelated, but this reminds me of natural fission reactors
 that ran for long periods of time (see [Natural nuclear fission
 reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor)).
