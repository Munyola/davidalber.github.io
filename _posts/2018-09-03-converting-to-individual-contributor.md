I've been an engineering manager for around 3.5 years, but starting
tomorrow, I will once again be an individual contributor. I'll be a
Technical Lead on a team that is responsible for events and
experimentation.

In reality, the transition will take some time. There's some work to
finish up, and I need to make sure my reports all transition well and
keep an eye on them.
