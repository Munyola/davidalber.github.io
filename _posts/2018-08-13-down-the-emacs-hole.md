I've been an Emacs user since college. My seriousness as an Emacs user
has varied over time, but I've probably never been much beyond
somewhere between casual and intermediate. I've long suspected that
I'm missing out on a lot of untapped efficiency potential, if only I
invested the hours needed to learn more.

Anyway, I've never used [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/), but for some
reason it's caught my interest now. I've started adding more
customization to my Emacs setup and trying out Org Mode. I've also
started watching a [video on
it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4). We'll see what comes
of this.
