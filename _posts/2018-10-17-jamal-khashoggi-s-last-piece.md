On October 2, Jamal Khashoggi, a dissident Saudi journalist residing
in the United States, walked into a Saudi consulate in Istanbul to
retrieve documents related to his upcoming wedding while his fianc√©e
waited outside. He was not seen by anyone outside the consulate after
that. Signs point to him having been [murdered inside the
consulate](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/world/middleeast/pompeo-khashoggi-murder.html),
and today [a recording, purporting to be of the killing, emerged from
Turkey](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/world/europe/turkey-saudi-khashoggi-dismember.html).

Khashoggi was a contributor to The Washington Post. [Jamal Khashoggi:

was pubished today. It is his final piece, and it is chilling.
