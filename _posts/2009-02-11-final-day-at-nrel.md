I have not posted yet that I have found a job in the Seattle area as a Research Scientist at Microsoft, mostly because I have been really busy as a result. More details on this will be coming.

Today is my last day at [NREL](http://www.nrel.gov/). The day will be filled with getting signatures for the check-out procedure (I am calling this the Treasure Hunt because it involves running all over the campus looking for people) and social events with group members.
