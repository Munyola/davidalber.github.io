It's been a long time since I've written about
[Geneagrapher](https://github.com/davidalber/geneagrapher). In fact, I
didn't expect to look at the project again, but thanks to
[activity](https://github.com/davidalber/geneagrapher/pull/20), I did
a little clean-up work recently. I decided it was time to take a look
at my graph. The amount of data in the [Mathematics Geanealogy
Project](https://github.com/davidalber/geneagrapher) has grown a lot
over past many years!
