This year’s RAGBRAI route was announced this weekend.

According to the
[announcement](http://ragbrai.com/2013/01/26/ragbrai-2013-short-south-through-des-moines/),
the ride is 406.6 miles and is the sixth easiest route in the
forty-one years of RAGBRAI. The overnight cities are Harlan, Perry,
Des Moines, Knoxville, Oskaloosa and Fairfield. This is the first stop
in Des Moines in sixteen years.

Here’s a [map](http://ragbrai.com/routemaps/2013-interactive-maps/) of
the route.

Last year’s ride was 471.1 miles and took place during a very hot
week. Here’s the [announcement

for that route.
