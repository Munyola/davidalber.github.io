Every so often I start wanting to build or buy a boat. It's just a thing I do, and I'm having those urges now. I've sailed the [Beetle Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle_Cat) at the [Center for Wooden Boats](http://cwb.org/) (CWB), and then I found that CWB is [planning to build](http://cwb.org/classes/kitten-boatbuilding-project/) a cat-rigged boat called a Kitten. They don't have any photos of what a Kitten looks like, so I searched around and found [this](http://areyspondboatyard.com/apby-built-boats/kitten-12/). I have no idea if that's the same boat, but it led me down a path of looking at that boat yard's other boats.

It seems like the boat yard specializes in catboats. Their [22-foot cruiser](http://areyspondboatyard.com/apby-built-boats/22-cruising-catboat/) looks pretty sweet. Check out the size of its sail in the video! That's 420 sqft. of sail area. Imagine what it would look like on their design for a [29-foot catboat](http://areyspondboatyard.com/apby-built-boats/29-catboat/), which is drafted to have a 900 sqft. sail!
