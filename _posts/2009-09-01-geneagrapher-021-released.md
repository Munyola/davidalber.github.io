Version 0.2.1 of the Geneagrapher is now available for
installation. This release does not add new features to the software,
but it does fix a debilitating issue that caused multiple advisors to
be ignored (this problem was introduced following changes to the
Mathematics Genealogy Project pages). Two users brought this to my
attention, and I am grateful for their help (although I initially
thought the problem was isolated to the recently-deleted, original
web-based version of the Geneagrapher).

_All pre-0.2.1 installations of the Geneagrapher should be updated to
Version 0.2.1._

Changes made for this release:

- Multiple advisors are now captured correctly. While this problem was
  manifesting itself, ancestor trees were coming out as a branch-free
  tree.
- Added a test for the multiple advisor case, which enables quicker
  recognition of similar problems.
- Updated a few tests that had become broken due to updates in the
  Math Genealogy Projectâ€™s database.

Since the features remain unchanged, please see the [Geneagrapher 0.2
release announcement](/2008/10/geneagrapher-02-released/) for more
information, including how to find and install the package.
