The four of us are beginning a journey to Iowa tomorrow and will be
there a couple days past the new year. We are doing something a little
crazy to get there: we are taking the train. The chance for this to go
sideways is pretty high, but in spite of that, I am not dreading the
trip.

We have a private suite for the four of us, which -- while not large
-- will make the journey a lot more tolerable, I believe. We will be
on the [Empire
Builder](https://www.amtrak.com/empire-builder-train). I'm really
looking forward to seeing Glacier National Park in the winter. The
kids don't really like sitting in the car, so there's been a lot of
resistance to traveling that far in the past. I'm hoping they will
really enjoy the things they see on the trip.
