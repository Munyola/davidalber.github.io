[SQLite's use of Fossil](https://sqlite.org/whynotgit.html) -- a
software configuration management system -- came up today on Hacker
News ([thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16806114)). Like
Git, Fossil is a distributed SCM, but it also has integrated bug
tracking, a built in web interface, and other features. There's
discussion on those pages comparing it to Git. If I had a reason to
try out other source control systems, Fossil might be fun to take a
look at.
