_This conversation happened around two years ago. Michael, his mother,
and I were watching an unusually large number of people come down the
sidewalk toward our house._

**Me:** Where are they coming from?

**Michael:** There must be a bar down there.

**CJ:** _Surprised that Michael knows what a bar is._ What's a bar?

**Michael:** You know what a bar is! Like a monkey bar!
