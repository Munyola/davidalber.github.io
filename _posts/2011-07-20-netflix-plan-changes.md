Netflix announced a [split of the streaming and by-mail movie
subscriptions](http://blog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-introduces-new-plans-and.html)
last week. The announcement led to an [uproar of
dissatisfaction](http://gigaom.com/video/netflix-price-hike/) with the
move, and I saw many comments accusing Netflix of greed.

My opinion is that Netflix certainly mishandled the announcement since
it gave no explanation for the changes, but many seem to forget that
Netflix is dependent on publishers to provide it with streaming
content, and these publishers motive, means, and opportunity to
negotiate much higher rates when contracts expire (as long as they can
see that Netflix has the profit to support the hike).

That view is confirmed in "[Netflix’s vanished Sony films are an
ominous
sign](http://money.cnn.com/2011/07/08/technology/netflix_starz_contract/index.htm)"
by analyst Michael Pachter, who estimates that the cost of Netflix’s
streaming contracts will increase from $180 million in 2010 to almost
$2 billion in 2012. The increase in streaming contract costs must play
some role in the plan changes.

I also expect that Netflix wants to start weaning customers off of
DVDs since the cost of that service is much higher for Netflix than
streaming -- at least until content providers raise costs beyond some
threshold.
