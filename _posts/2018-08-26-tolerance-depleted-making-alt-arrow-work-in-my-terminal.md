For a long time I have tolerated not being able to do Alt+Arrow in my
terminal to hop over words. Alt+Backspace deletes single words, but
Alt+Left inserts "[D" and Alt+Right inserts "[C". Maddening! I've
finally bothered to do something about it, and it was easy on my
MacBook in iTerm2. See
[here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/218639). I only just switched
it, but a quick run through of a lot of use cases did not turn up any
surprises.

So much better!

Bonus: Alt+Arrow was working the way I want in Emacs before this
change. However, I had this thing going on in [Org
Mode](https://orgmode.org/) where Alt+Arrow was changing the depth of
header items instead of hopping over words. Now it works as expected
in this case. I can still change header depth with Shift+Alt+Arrow.
