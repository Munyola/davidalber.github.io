I clearly recall being told in elementary school that the skin colors
of dinosaurs are unknown because the necessary parts do not survive
the fossilization process. I think that bothered me at first. I got
over it eventually and had no trouble accepting that dinosaurs
probably were similar in color to some selection of extant
reptiles. Still that’s not as nice as knowing for sure.

Let’s put aside dinosaur skin color for now. Scientists have
discovered pigments in the protofeathers of some dinosaur fossils. The
new observations are of melanin-containing organelles called
melanosomes, which exist in the feathers of birds today.

> The two most common types of melanin found in modern birds are
  eumelanin, associated with black and grey feathers, and
  phaeomelanin, found in reddish brown to yellow feathers.

Both of these types melanin were seen in the fossils being studied.
