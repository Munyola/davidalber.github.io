Nine weeks ago we placed an order for a new cargo bike: a [Packster
80](https://www.r-m.de/e-cargo/packster-80/). It was built in Germany
and slowly made its way here. Today we picked it up.

We bought it because it's amazing, it will save us a bunch of time,
will pay for itself surprisingly quickly, we love riding it, and our
kids love riding in it.

I'm going to get great pictures of it and post them in the future, but
here's one from the shop floor.

The ride home was a good sign of enjoyment to come. I can't
comfortably ride an unmotorized bike with both kids on board now. They
are too heavy, and it's too hilly here! The Packster 80 ride was
great. We took a slightly-indirect route home, riding around part of
Green Lake and through Woodland Park.
