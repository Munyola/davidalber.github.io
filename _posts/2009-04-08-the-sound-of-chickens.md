A couple weekends back I caught an episode of [A Prairie Home Companion](http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/). It happened to be their "[joke show](http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/2009/03/14/)", which included "The Sound of Chickens", a parody of "The Sound of Silence" by Simon and Garfunkel. The song was actually a repeat from last yearâ€™s joke show. Listen to it [here](http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/2008/03/08/scripts/chickens.shtml).

The show was pretty entertaining, but in addition to the song, the following joke sticks out in my mind:

> Q: What do you call a lawyer who has gone bad?
>
> A: Senator.
