Last week, on Valentine's Day, Chao-Jen and I went to Hamilton at the
Paramount Theater in Seattle. I've been listening to the soundtrack
from Hamilton for half a year, so I was already familiar with the
lyrics, especially up through "One Last Time". The experience was
_amazing_.

The story, which triggers a lot of introspection in me, is
inspirational, tragic, and funny at the right times. Seeing it in
person was incredible, and I would go again if I get the chance. I
wish to go again.

We obtained our tickets in a charity auction for the [Friends of FSH
Research](http://fshfriends.org/). I'm so grateful to Chao-Jen for
relentlessly bidding for the tickets, both because it supports FSH
research and because I may not have created the opportunity to see
Hamilton on my own.
