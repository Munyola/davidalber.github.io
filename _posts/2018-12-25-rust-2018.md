[Rust
2018](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/Rust-1.31-and-rust-2018.html)
was the Rust v1.31.0 release on December 6. I read through the release
notes shortly after it was released, but just now finally read through
[Rust 2018 is hereâ€¦ but what is
it?](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/12/rust-2018-is-here/) to get
another perspective on it.

I'm pretty excited about the upcoming async/await syntax and have a
situation where I would like to use it. I was looking at using Tokio
right now, but since I am not in an immediate rush I can wait a little
bit to see how everything shakes out. Hopefully it won't be too long!

I should start using
[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) when I am writing
Rust code because I usually do it in isolation (at least right
now). Having a tool help me write more idiomatic code is really
valuable.

The post talks about changes to macros. I've been intending to learn
more about writing macros, and there are some tidbits in the post that
make me think now is a good time to do that.

I still do not write Rust mostly out of interest, but there's
something I really like about the language and community that keeps me
going.
