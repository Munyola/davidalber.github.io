In the comment section of an article about an [indecorous argument
between two
U.S. Representatives](http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/07/19/2321651/west-trashes-wasserman-schultz.html)
there was a post by an apparent future opponent of one of the elected
officials (most ellipses are mine):

> Help me defeat ..., come to my town hall rally this Saturday July 23rd
  from 1pm to 4pm at ... located at ... We need to bring true ... values
  back to congress and in district 20.http://...

Later in the thread was this hilarious response:

> Hahaha...campaigning on a newspaper message board? Was Craigslist
  down or something? You should put up some "guitar lesson" fliers up
  at the local mall to see if you can attract some more support. Maybe
  you can sneak in frame behind the local "on location" weather guy
  with a poster or something. Hahaha...I'm an indie from CO and have
  no dog in this race, but this style of politicking is pretty rich!
  Good luck.
