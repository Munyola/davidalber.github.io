I spent a little time implementing [Delaunay
triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation)
for learning. I am going to do a little more work on it, but hereâ€™s an
example of its output.

The code is still a mess, and will be updated, but you can find it
[here](https://github.com/davidalber/algbox/blob/master/src/algbox/delaunay.py). You
need Python with matplotlib to run the code.
