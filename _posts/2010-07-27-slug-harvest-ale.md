I am locked in an epic battle with slugs determined to destroy the
cucumbers and squash in my garden. They have taken the initiative
repeatedly and struck from the shadows. In fact, I had cucumbers and
squash growing in May that were completely destroyed long before I
knew what was hitting me.

I have prior gardening experience, but gardening in the Pacific
Northwest —- with its slugs -— is a new adventure for me. We have
slugs in Iowa, but they are not even worth mentioning when discussing
the shell-less land mollusks living here.

A couple weeks ago I planted new cucumbers and squash (I know, it's
late), and the slugs are back in lesser numbers. I have spent time
investigating my options. Did you know that slugs do not like moving
over copper? Aside from copper, various types of molluscides are
available, but that's not for me. The most appealing option to me is
the judicious deployment of defensive structures, and I found the
information in "Slug Fences" very useful.

Unfortunately, I am working with entire hills of plants, so I had to
modify the most attractive portions of the slug fence design and
installation method. After purchasing the necessary materials and
finding a time when nobody else was around, I set to constructing my
first fortification. It did not take long to realize the large time
investment that would be needed to construct all of the walls, and
they would not even be that great when finished! Desperate, I fell
back on the beer trap trick: bury a cup (or some suitably-sized
vessel) up to its brim and fill half way with beer. It sounds a little
ridiculous, and the guy in the grocery store clearly thought so
too. Slugs apparently like the smell of beer, fall in, get drunk, then
drown. There is no need to tell me that sounds evil; I already feel
bad about it. Remember: _they started this_. Of all of the plants at
my garden site, the slugs have a strong preference for cucumber and
squash seedlings. Once the plants have grown a little, I will remove
the traps.

I deployed the cups and beer last night and checked the traps this
morning. Regrettably, the system is not at all discriminating. Of the
creatures large enough for me to see, three spiders and one slug were
eliminated.

If I ever find myself brewing beer, it will be named 'Slug Harvest
Ale' to memorialize my worthy, fallen opponents.
