Scientists revealed the discovery of a lake beneath the southern polar
region on Mars. The lake was detected using an instrument called
[MARSIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARSIS) on the European Space
Agency's [Mars Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Express)
spacecraft. It's apparently not necessarily a large lake, but it's
still exciting to have found. Read more about it
