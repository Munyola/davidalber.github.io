_This is ancient history now, but it is part of my origin story._

## Pre-Doctoral

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in May 2007. I specialized in scientific
computing and am particularly interested in algorithm and data
structure design and development. My dissertation, titled [Efficient
Setup Algorithms for Parallel Algebraic
Multigrid](/publications/thesis.pdf), focused on parallel coarse grid
selection algorithms for algebraic multigrid (AMG) and was conducted
under the guidance of my advisors Luke Olson and Paul Saylor.

I earned a M.S. in Computer Science at UIUC in 2004 under the guidance
of Paul Saylor. My Masters research was influenced heavily by the work
I did in my first summer at the Center for Applied Scientific
Computing at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

Further back, I earned a B.S. in Biological Science and Computer
Science at the University of Iowa.

## Post-Doctoral

Shortly after completing my Ph.D., I started a postdoctoral position
in the Scientific Computing Center (now the Computational Science
Center) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden,
Colorado.

My primary project at NREL was part of a computational systems biology
project called "Green Energy: Advancing Bio-hydrogen". Briefly, the
project aimed to: (1) construct a comprehensive metabolic model for the
hydrogen-producing green alga _Chlamydomonas reinhardtii_; (2) produce
high-performance software for solving problems arising from the rate
equations encoded in the model.

After NREL, I worked at Microsoft. Initially, my role there was to
research topics in numerical linear algebra and other areas of
scientific computing with the goal of producing a high-performance
numerical library targeted at exploiting systems with large numbers of
processing cores.
